# Task 02: Basic Drag-and-Drop Flow UI

## Goal
Implement a basic drag-and-drop interface using React Flow in Next.js:
- Let users add/remove nodes and edges.
- Store node/edge data in Supabase.

## Steps
1. Reference [PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md](../PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md) for the front-end architecture.
2. Install and configure React Flow in the frontend.
3. Create a simple canvas that supports basic node creation/deletion.
4. Introduce a minimal "Workflow" model in Supabase to persist node/edge data in a JSON column.
5. Provide a REST or GraphQL endpoint to save/update this workflow data.
6. Add minimal UI styling (Tailwind) for the canvas area.

## Expected Outcome
- A working page in Next.js that shows a drag-and-drop canvas.
- Ability to add or remove nodes/edges.
- Successfully saving workflow data to Supabase.

## Summary
Task completed successfully with the following achievements:

1. **React Flow Integration**:
   - Installed and configured React Flow in Next.js frontend
   - Created `WorkflowCanvas` component for drag-and-drop functionality
   - Implemented node/edge addition and removal capabilities

2. **Database Integration**:
   - Created `workflows` table in Supabase with JSON columns for nodes/edges
   - Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection
   - Added automatic timestamp handling for created_at/updated_at

3. **API Implementation**:
   - Created REST endpoint `/api/workflows` for saving workflows
   - Implemented GraphQL mutations and queries via TypeGraphQL
   - Added proper authentication handling for both REST and GraphQL routes

4. **UI Development**:
   - Added Tailwind styling for workflow canvas
   - Implemented responsive layout
   - Added user-friendly controls for workflow management

5. **Testing & Validation**:
   - Created contract tests for API endpoints
   - Verified workflow saving functionality
   - Implemented proper error handling and user feedback

The drag-and-drop workflow builder is now fully functional and integrated with the backend storage.
