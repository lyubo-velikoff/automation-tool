# Task 02: Basic Drag-and-Drop Flow UI

## Goal
Implement a basic drag-and-drop interface using React Flow in Next.js:
- Let users add/remove nodes and edges.
- Store node/edge data in Supabase.

## Steps
1. Reference [PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md](../PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md) for the front-end architecture.
2. Install and configure React Flow in the frontend.
3. Create a simple canvas that supports basic node creation/deletion.
4. Introduce a minimal "Workflow" model in Supabase to persist node/edge data in a JSON column.
5. Provide a REST or GraphQL endpoint to save/update this workflow data.
6. Add minimal UI styling (Tailwind) for the canvas area.

## Expected Outcome
- A working page in Next.js that shows a drag-and-drop canvas.
- Ability to add or remove nodes/edges.
- Successfully saving workflow data to Supabase.
