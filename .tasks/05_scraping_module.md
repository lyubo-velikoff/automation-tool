# Task 05: Scraping Module

## Goal
Implement a scraping module to extract data from a given URL.

## Steps
1. Reference [PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md](../PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md) for integration guidelines.
2. Integrate Cheerio for HTML parsing.
3. Optionally use Puppeteer/Playwright for JS-rendered pages.
4. Let users define CSS selectors or XPath.
5. Return scraped data to subsequent workflow steps.

## Expected Outcome
- Configurable scraping node in the workflow.
- Basic protection against abuse (rate limits or usage logs).
- Data can feed into other nodes.

## Summary
The scraping module has been successfully implemented with the following features:

1. **Core Components**:
   - ScrapingNode class for type definitions
   - ScrapingService for handling scraping operations
   - React component for node configuration
   - GraphQL resolver for scraping operations

2. **Features**:
   - URL input with validation
   - CSS and XPath selector support
   - Optional attribute extraction
   - Rate limiting (100 requests per IP per 15 minutes)
   - Error handling and logging

3. **Integration**:
   - Added to workflow builder UI
   - Integrated with existing node system
   - Updated project documentation

4. **Testing Instructions**:
   To test the scraping functionality locally:
   1. Add a scraping node to your workflow
   2. Configure URL and selector
   3. Connect to other nodes (e.g., OpenAI for processing)
   4. Run the workflow to see scraped data
