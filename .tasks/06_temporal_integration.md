# Task 06: Temporal.io Integration

## Goal
Add temporal-based scheduling and state management for workflow runs.

## Steps
1. Reference [PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md](../PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md) for orchestration guidelines.
2. Install and configure Temporal.io in the Node.js backend.
3. Create a sample "timer-based" workflow (run every X minutes).
4. Integrate with existing nodes so each step triggers in order.
5. Handle retries and error reporting.

## Expected Outcome
- A stable, scheduled workflow system using Temporal.io.
- Basic run history and logging.

## Summary
Successfully integrated Temporal.io for workflow scheduling and execution:

1. **Core Components Added**:
   - Temporal client configuration
   - Worker setup for executing workflows
   - Timed workflow implementation
   - Node execution activities

2. **Features Implemented**:
   - Configurable interval-based workflow execution
   - Sequential node execution based on dependencies
   - Error handling and logging
   - GraphQL mutations for starting/stopping workflows

3. **Integration Points**:
   - Added to workflow resolver
   - Connected with existing node types
   - Integrated with server startup

4. **Environment Setup**:
   - Added Temporal server address configuration
   - Updated documentation with new requirements

The integration allows workflows to be scheduled and executed at specified intervals, with proper error handling and dependency management between nodes.
