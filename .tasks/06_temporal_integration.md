# Task 06: Temporal.io Integration

## Goal
Add temporal-based scheduling and state management for workflow runs.

## Steps
1. Reference [PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md](../PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md) for orchestration guidelines.
2. Install and configure Temporal.io in the Node.js backend.
3. Create a sample "timer-based" workflow (run every X minutes).
4. Integrate with existing nodes so each step triggers in order.
5. Handle retries and error reporting.

## Expected Outcome
- A stable, scheduled workflow system using Temporal.io.
- Basic run history and logging.

## Summary
