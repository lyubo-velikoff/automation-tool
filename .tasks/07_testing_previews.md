# Task 07: Testing & Previews

## Goal
Ensure thorough testing and preview deployments for each feature branch.

## Steps
1. Reference [PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md](../PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md) for testing & CI/CD guidelines.
2. Expand Jest unit tests (email sending, scraping, etc.).
3. Add or update Playwright E2E tests to cover major features.
4. Configure GitHub Actions so each PR branch deploys a preview (e.g., Vercel).
5. Document how to run tests and see previews in the README.

## Expected Outcome
- Codebase has robust tests.
- Each branch has a preview link.
- Merges only happen after tests pass.

## Summary
*(AI should fill this in after successful task completion)*
