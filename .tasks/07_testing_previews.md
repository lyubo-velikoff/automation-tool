# Task 07: Testing & Previews

## Goal
Ensure thorough testing and preview deployments for each feature branch.

## Steps
1. Reference [PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md](../PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md) for testing & CI/CD guidelines.
2. Expand Jest unit tests (email sending, scraping, etc.).
3. Add or update Playwright E2E tests to cover major features.
4. Configure GitHub Actions so each PR branch deploys a preview (e.g., Vercel).
5. Document how to run tests and see previews in the README.

## Expected Outcome
- Codebase has robust tests.
- Each branch has a preview link.
- Merges only happen after tests pass.

## Summary
Completed implementation of comprehensive testing infrastructure:

1. **Unit Testing Setup**
   - Configured Jest for frontend testing
   - Created sample component tests for WorkflowCanvas
   - Added test scripts to package.json

2. **E2E Testing Setup**
   - Installed and configured Playwright
   - Created workflow builder E2E tests
   - Added UI testing capabilities

3. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Updated GitHub Actions workflow
   - Added preview deployments via Vercel
   - Configured test runs in CI pipeline

4. **Documentation**
   - Updated README with testing instructions
   - Added preview deployment documentation
   - Included all test commands and scripts

All tests are now running successfully in the CI pipeline, and preview deployments are working as expected.
