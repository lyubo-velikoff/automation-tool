# Task 05: Multi-URL Scraping Node

## Goal
Create a new node type that can process multiple URLs using the existing scraping functionality, designed to work seamlessly with the current single URL scraper and OpenAI nodes.

## Background
- Current scraping node handles single URLs effectively
- Need to process arrays of URLs (e.g., from forum links, search results)
- Results need to be combined for OpenAI analysis
- Must maintain performance and reliability at scale

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. New "Multi-URL Scraper" node that:
   - Accepts array of URLs as input
   - Uses same selector/attribute configuration as single URL scraper
   - Combines results in a structured format
   - Handles varying numbers of URLs (10-50+)

2. Integration with existing nodes:
   - Accept results from single URL scraper node
   - Format output suitable for OpenAI node
   - Maintain workflow context for variable interpolation

### Technical Requirements
1. Reuse existing functionality:
   - ScrapingService core logic
   - Validation and error handling
   - UI components and configurations
   - Type definitions and interfaces

2. Performance considerations:
   - Implement concurrent scraping
   - Configurable batch size
   - Rate limiting
   - Timeout settings
   - Memory management for large results

3. Error handling:
   - Continue on individual URL failures
   - Configurable failure threshold
   - Detailed error reporting
   - Progress tracking

### UI/UX Requirements
1. Node configuration:
   - Reuse existing scraping configuration UI
   - Add batch processing settings
   - Progress indication
   - Error visibility

2. Result display:
   - Show combined results
   - Individual URL status
   - Error summary

## Implementation Strategy

### Server-Side
1. Create new node type extending base functionality
2. Reuse ScrapingService for core operations
3. Add batch processing orchestration
4. Implement concurrent processing with safety limits

### Web App
1. Create new node component
2. Reuse existing configuration components
3. Add batch-specific settings
4. Enhance result display for multiple URLs

## Component Structure
```
Server
├─ ScrapingService (existing)
├─ SingleURLNode (existing)
└─ MultiURLNode (new)
    ├─ Uses ScrapingService
    └─ Adds batch processing

Web
├─ Shared Components (reuse)
│  ├─ SelectorInput
│  ├─ AttributeSelection
│  └─ TemplateConfig
└─ MultiURLNode (new)
    ├─ Uses shared components
    └─ Adds batch settings
```

## Data Flow
```
Single URL Scraper (gets URLs) 
     ↓
Multi URL Scraper (processes array)
     ↓
OpenAI Node (analyzes combined content)
```

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests:
   - Batch processing logic
   - Error handling
   - Rate limiting

2. Integration tests:
   - End-to-end workflow
   - Performance with various URL counts
   - Error scenarios

## Future Considerations
1. Caching for frequently accessed URLs
2. Advanced batch configuration
3. Result filtering/transformation
4. Export capabilities
5. Progress persistence

## Dependencies
- Existing ScrapingService
- React Flow
- OpenAI integration
- Rate limiting utilities

## Notes
- Consider implementing as separate node rather than enhancing existing scraper
- Focus on reusability and maintainability
- Ensure robust error handling
- Monitor performance with large URL sets
