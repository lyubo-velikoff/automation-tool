# Task 01: Project Setup & Dependencies

## Goal
Initialize the monorepo (or single repo) with:
- Next.js (with Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, React Flow)
- Node.js backend (Express + Apollo Server + TypeGraphQL)
- Bun as package manager
- GitHub Actions for CI
- Minimal Supabase setup

## Steps
1. Reference [PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md](../PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md) for the tech stack.
2. Create a new repository or monorepo structure.
3. Install dependencies with Bun (note any conflicts).
4. Configure Tailwind + shadcn/ui in Next.js.
5. Set up Express in `backend/` (or within Next.js routes).
6. Configure Apollo Server with TypeGraphQL.
7. Create a basic GitHub Actions file (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) to run Jest tests.
8. Document the final file structure in `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` or `README.md`.

## Expected Outcome
- A codebase installable with Bun.
- A functional Next.js app with Tailwind + shadcn/ui.
- A minimal Express+Apollo backend.
- Basic CI pipeline passing on GitHub Actions.

## Summary
Task completed successfully with the following achievements:

1. **Monorepo Structure**:
   - Set up using pnpm workspaces (Bun was not used due to Windows compatibility)
   - Configured Turborepo for monorepo management
   - Created apps/web (frontend) and apps/server (backend) directories

2. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Next.js 15.1.5 with TypeScript
   - Tailwind CSS configured
   - shadcn/ui installed and configured
   - React Flow added as dependency

3. **Backend Setup**:
   - Express server with TypeScript
   - Apollo Server Express for GraphQL
   - TypeGraphQL integration
   - Hybrid API approach with both REST and GraphQL endpoints
   - Basic health check endpoints added

4. **Development Environment**:
   - Concurrent development setup with `pnpm dev`
   - Hot reloading for both frontend and backend
   - TypeScript compilation and type checking

5. **CI/CD**:
   - GitHub Actions workflow configured
   - Runs build and tests on push/PR to main
   - Uses pnpm for dependency management

6. **Documentation**:
   - Comprehensive README.md with setup instructions
   - Project structure documented
   - Development commands listed

The project is now ready for further feature development with a solid foundation for the automation tool.
