# Task 04: OpenAI Integration (MVP)

## Goal
Add OpenAI's ChatGPT/completion features to the workflow.

## Steps
1. Reference [PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md](../PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md) for integration guidelines.
2. Create an "OpenAI" node that accepts a prompt and returns a completion.
3. Support GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 if available.
4. Integrate the node into the workflow, allowing subsequent steps to use its output.

## Expected Outcome
- A user can add an "OpenAI step" in the workflow builder.
- System calls OpenAI API, returning a text response.
- Step output can be passed to subsequent nodes.

## Summary
Implemented OpenAI integration with the following components:
1. OpenAI service with configuration and API client
2. CompletionNode for workflow integration
3. GraphQL resolver for OpenAI operations
4. Frontend mutations for OpenAI completions
5. Updated project documentation with OpenAI details

Key features:
- Support for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models
- Configurable parameters (max tokens, temperature)
- Validation of API credentials
- Error handling and logging
- Type-safe GraphQL operations
