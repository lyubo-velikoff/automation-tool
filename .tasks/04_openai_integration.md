# Task 04: OpenAI Integration (MVP)

## Goal
Add OpenAI's ChatGPT/completion features to the workflow.

## Steps
1. Reference [PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md](../PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md) for integration guidelines.
2. Create an "OpenAI" node that accepts a prompt and returns a completion.
3. Support GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 if available.
4. Integrate the node into the workflow, allowing subsequent steps to use its output.

## Expected Outcome
- A user can add an "OpenAI step" in the workflow builder.
- System calls OpenAI API, returning a text response.
- Step output can be passed to subsequent nodes.

## Summary
*(AI should fill this in after successful task completion)*
