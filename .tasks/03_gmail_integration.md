# Task 03: Gmail Integration (MVP)

## Goal
Connect to Gmail, enabling:
- OAuth2 sign-in for a user's Gmail account
- "New Email" as a trigger
- "Send Email" as an action

## Steps
1. Reference [PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md](../PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md) for integration guidelines.
2. Set up OAuth2 with Google's APIs.
3. Create a "trigger node" for new emails (poll every X minutes).
4. Create an "action node" for sending an email.
5. Integrate these into the workflow builder.

## Expected Outcome
- Users can connect their Gmail account.
- System detects new emails (basic polling).
- Users can send emails from a workflow.

## Summary
Implemented Gmail integration with the following components:

1. OAuth2 Configuration:
   - Set up Google OAuth2 client with required scopes
   - Added environment variables for credentials
   - Implemented authentication flow

2. Gmail Service:
   - Created GmailService class for API operations
   - Implemented methods for reading and sending emails
   - Added email parsing and formatting utilities

3. Workflow Nodes:
   - EmailTriggerNode: Polls for new emails with configurable filters
   - EmailActionNode: Sends emails with template variable support

4. GraphQL Integration:
   - Added GmailResolver for GraphQL operations
   - Implemented queries and mutations for Gmail operations
   - Created type definitions for email data

5. Testing:
   - Added unit tests for Gmail service and nodes
   - Implemented test cases for email operations
   - Added mock data for testing

The implementation follows the project's architecture guidelines and integrates seamlessly with the existing workflow builder.
