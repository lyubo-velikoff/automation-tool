Please read ".tasks/04_openai_integration.md" and "PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md" for OpenAI-related guidelines.

**Task**:
1. Create an "OpenAI" node that accepts a user prompt and returns a response (GPT-3.5 or GPT-4).
2. Integrate with existing workflow logic so subsequent nodes can use the AI's output.
3. Store minimal logs of prompt/response if desired.
4. After successful completion, fill out "## Summary" in ".tasks/04_openai_integration.md".
5. Make sure to check with me if I am happy for you to commit all files, push and then merge the created branch to main branch. Additionally, make sure to analyse and then update PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md and .cursorrules files located in the root folder with project structure any any helpful info to help give you better context for future prompts

**Notes**:
- Use branch "feature/task-04-openai-integration".
- Ensure any credentials are stored securely, referencing Supabase if needed.
- See "PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md" for further tech stack details.
