Please read ".tasks/07_testing_previews.md" and "PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md" to ensure robust testing and preview deployments.

**Task**:
1. Expand Jest unit tests for major integrations (Gmail, OpenAI, Scraping).
2. Add or update Playwright E2E tests to cover the workflow builder and integrations.
3. Configure GitHub Actions so each PR branch deploys a preview (Vercel or similar).
4. Document how to run tests and see previews in the README.
5. After successful completion, fill out "## Summary" in ".tasks/07_testing_previews.md".
6. Make sure to commit all files, push and then merge the created branch to main branch

**Notes**:
- Use branch "feature/task-07-testing-previews".
- Merge only when all tests pass.
- Reference "PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md" for overall guidelines.
