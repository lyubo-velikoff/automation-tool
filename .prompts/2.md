Please read ".tasks/02_drag_drop_flow.md" and "PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md" for details on the drag-and-drop UI requirements.

**Task**:
1. Install and configure React Flow in the Next.js frontend.
2. Create a basic workflow canvas for adding/removing nodes and edges.
3. Store the node/edge data in Supabase (JSON column).
4. Provide a REST or GraphQL endpoint to save/update workflows.
5. Add minimal UI styling via Tailwind.
6. After successful completion, fill out the "## Summary" section in ".tasks/02_drag_drop_flow.md".
7. Make sure to check with me if I am happy for you to commit all files, push and then merge the created branch to main branch. Additionally, make sure to analyse and then update PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md and .cursorrules files located in the root folder with project structure any any helpful info to help give you better context for future prompts

**Notes**:
- Use branch "feature/task-02-drag-drop".
- Ensure everything builds properly and test it locally or via a preview deployment.
- Reference "PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md" as needed.
