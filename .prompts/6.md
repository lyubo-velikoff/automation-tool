Please read ".tasks/06_temporal_integration.md" and "PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md" to integrate Temporal.io.

**Task**:
1. Install and configure Temporal.io in the Node.js backend.
2. Create a sample timed workflow (e.g., run every 15 minutes).
3. Integrate existing nodes so each step triggers in sequence.
4. Handle retries and error reporting through Temporal.io.
5. After successful completion, fill out "## Summary" in ".tasks/06_temporal_integration.md".
6. Merge the task branch back to "main" branch

**Notes**:
- Use branch "feature/task-06-temporal-integration".
- Reference the architecture in "PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md".
- Provide an example of how to set or change the interval in the code or UI.
