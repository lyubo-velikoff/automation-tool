Please read ".tasks/06_temporal_integration.md" and "PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md" to integrate Temporal.io.

**Task**:
1. Install and configure Temporal.io in the Node.js backend.
2. Create a sample timed workflow (e.g., run every 15 minutes).
3. Integrate existing nodes so each step triggers in sequence.
4. Handle retries and error reporting through Temporal.io.
5. After successful completion, fill out "## Summary" in ".tasks/06_temporal_integration.md".
6. Make sure to check with me if I am happy for you to commit all files, push and then merge the created branch to main branch. Additionally, make sure to analyse and then update PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md and .cursorrules files located in the root folder with project structure any any helpful info to help give you better context for future prompts

**Notes**:
- Use branch "feature/task-06-temporal-integration".
- Reference the architecture in "PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md".
- Provide an example of how to set or change the interval in the code or UI.
