Please read ".tasks/05_scraping_module.md" and "PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md" for guidelines on the Scraping Module.

**Task**:
1. Integrate Cheerio for HTML parsing, optionally add Puppeteer/Playwright for JavaScript-heavy pages.
2. Let users define CSS selectors or XPath in the workflow node.
3. Return scraped data to subsequent workflow steps.
4. Add basic rate limiting or logs to prevent abuse.
5. After successful completion, fill out "## Summary" in ".tasks/05_scraping_module.md".
6. Make sure to check with me if I am happy for you to commit all files, push and then merge the created branch to main branch. Additionally, make sure to analyse and then update PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md and .cursorrules files located in the root folder with project structure any any helpful info to help give you better context for future prompts

**Notes**:
- Use branch "feature/task-05-scraping-module".
- Reference "PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md" for the overall architecture.
- Provide instructions on how to test scraping locally or in a preview environment.
