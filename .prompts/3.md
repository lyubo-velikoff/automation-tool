Please read ".tasks/03_gmail_integration.md" and "PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md" to see how we plan to integrate Gmail.

**Task**:
1. Set up OAuth2 with Gmail.
2. Create a "trigger node" for new emails (polled every X minutes).
3. Create an "action node" for sending emails.
4. Integrate these into the existing workflow builder so users can configure Gmail steps.
5. After successful completion, fill out "## Summary" in ".tasks/03_gmail_integration.md".
6. Make sure to check with me if I am happy for you to commit all files, push and then merge the created branch to main branch. Additionally, make sure to analyse and then update PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md and .cursorrules files located in the root folder with project structure any any helpful info to help give you better context for future prompts

**Notes**:
- Use branch "feature/task-03-gmail-integration".
- Verify your solution using Jest/Playwright tests if applicable.
- Follow the architecture and guidelines in "PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md".
