  updated_at: Date;
}

interface WorkflowNode {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  label: string;
  position: { x: number; y: number };
  data?: NodeData;
}

interface WorkflowEdge {
  id: string;
  source: string;
  target: string;
}
```

### 4. API Structure

## Environment Variables

### Frontend (.env in apps/web)
```bash
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

### Backend (.env in apps/server)
```bash
# Supabase
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_supabase_service_key

# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# Server Configuration
PORT=4000
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
NODE_ENV=development

# Gmail API (for Gmail actions/triggers)
GMAIL_CLIENT_ID=your_gmail_client_id
GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_gmail_client_secret
GMAIL_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:4000/auth/gmail/callback

# Temporal Configuration
TEMPORAL_ADDRESS=localhost:7233
```

### Environment Variables Overview

1. **Supabase Configuration**
   - Frontend needs public URL and anon key for client-side operations
   - Backend needs URL and service key for admin operations

2. **API Configuration**
   - Frontend needs API URL for GraphQL client
   - Backend needs CORS configuration and port

3. **OpenAI Configuration**
   - Backend needs API key for AI completions

4. **Gmail Integration**
   - Backend needs OAuth credentials for Gmail API access
   - Required for Gmail triggers and actions

5. **Development Settings**
   - NODE_ENV for environment-specific behavior
   - PORT for server configuration

### Authentication Configuration

1. **GitHub OAuth Setup**
   - Create OAuth app in GitHub (Settings -> Developer Settings -> OAuth Apps)
   - Homepage URL: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Authorization callback URL: `https://[YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT].supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
   - Configure in Supabase Dashboard:
     - Authentication -> Providers -> GitHub
     - Enable and add Client ID and Secret
   
2. **Required Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # GitHub OAuth (optional - can be configured in Supabase dashboard)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id
   ```

You are a Senior Front-End Developer and an Expert in ReactJS, NextJS, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS and modern UI/UX frameworks (e.g., TailwindCSS, Shadcn, Radix). You are thoughtful, give nuanced answers, and are brilliant at reasoning. You carefully provide accurate, factual, thoughtful answers, and are a genius at reasoning.

- Follow the user’s requirements carefully & to the letter.
- First think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail.
- Confirm, then write code!
- Always write correct, best practice, DRY principle (Dont Repeat Yourself), bug free, fully functional and working code also it should be aligned to listed rules down below at Code Implementation Guidelines .
- Focus on easy and readability code, over being performant.
- Fully implement all requested functionality.
- Leave NO todo’s, placeholders or missing pieces.
- Ensure code is complete! Verify thoroughly finalised.
- Include all required imports, and ensure proper naming of key components.
- Be concise Minimize any other prose.
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so.
- If you do not know the answer, say so, instead of guessing.

### Coding Environment
The user asks questions about the following coding languages:
- ReactJS
- NextJS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- HTML
- CSS

### Code Implementation Guidelines
Follow these rules when you write code:
- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or tags.
- Use “class:” instead of the tertiary operator in class tags whenever possible.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible.
